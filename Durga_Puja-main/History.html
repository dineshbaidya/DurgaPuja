<h6>Celebrated in the month of Ashvin (September - October), Durga puja (fondly referred to as Pujo) is one of the most awaited festivals in India, especially in West Bengal. Even though the weather starts becoming cooler, the air is thick with the warmth radiated by the devotees.</h6>
<h6>The origins of the Devi as a deity are lost in the mists of time. Over time, we find mentions of the Goddess in various texts from the Vedic era and also in the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Even much later, Krittivasi’s rendition of Ramayana, composed in the 15th century, speaks of Durga being worshipped with 108 blue lotuses and 108 sacred lamps by Lord Rama before his battle with Ravana. The day that Lord Rama defeated Ravana is celebrated as Dussehra which falls on the tenth day (Dashami) of the Durga puja.</h6>
<h6>In literature from around the 16th century we find the first mentions of the grand celebration of Durga puja by zamindars (landlords) in West Bengal. Different scripts point to different rajas (kings) and zamindars who celebrated and financed the Durga puja for the whole village. The Boendo Bariri Pujo (Puja in the house of zamindars) still remains a custom in Bengal. The bigger households, place the idol in their courtyards of their havelis for people to come and pray to the Goddess Durga.</h6>
<h6>One of the most famous institutions of Kolkata is the Belur Math. The headquarters of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, Belur Math was founded by Swami Vivekanand. Established on the western bank of the Hoogly river, this Math hosts a very popular Durga puja. The first Durga puja here was held in 1901 by Swami Vivekananda himself. Initially, celebrated inside a small pandal, the Durga puja at Belur Math now attracts thousands of people every year.</h6>

  <p>༺ History Of Mahalaya ༻</p>
</div>
<br>
<h6>Mahalaya is celebrated at the beginning of the Durga Pooja festival, which is observed in the states of Karnataka, Odisha, Tripura, and West Bengal. According to Hindu mythology, it is believed that on this day Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheswar created Goddess Durga to defeat the demon king Mahishasura.It is the last day of Pitru Paksha aka Sarva Pitru Amavasya.Therefore, this day is marked as the arrival of Goddess Durga to Earth with her ultimate power. This day is celebrated with beautifully designed statues of Goddess Durga. Various rituals are performed, like offering a tarpan, remembering the ancestors, and establishing the idol of Durga Maa in houses and pandals.</h6>
<h6>As per Hindu beliefs, Goddess Durga visits her paternal house in Mahalaya. The beliefs believe that Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheshwar created Maa Durga to eliminate the powerful demon whom devatas and human beings were unable to kill Mahisasura.</h6>
<h6>The Devaloka was ruled by Mahisasure and to protect themselves, the devatas and Lord Vishnu worshipped Adi Shakti to diminish the Asura.The fight between Goddess Durga and Mahisasura took place for around 9 days and on the 10th day, Goddess Durga killed the demon and with this started the beginning of Navratri and Durga Puja.</h6>
<h6>The day is significant as it is the end of Pitru Paksha Shraddha and the beginning of Durga Puja for the Bengali community and some parts of India. Pitru Paksha marks the period to worship the ancestors and offer them prayers.</h6>
<h6>On this day, the devotees pay homage to their forefathers through a tarpan or shraddha. From this day, the Goddess Durga started her journey from Kailash to the Earth. It is considered that she travelled on a palanquin, boat or elephant, or by horse. Durga puja begins on the seventh day of Mahalaya and ends on the tenth day of Dusshera.</h6>
